# jsh

A solution to the ever-present problem of helping a colleague with a (relatively) clunky/inefficient terminal without proper tooling. JSH is *the* solution since it effectively allows for immediate ENV switching for quick help/debugging.

## Usage

Loading a specific user ENV is done as follows:

```shell script
source jsh user=josh
```
